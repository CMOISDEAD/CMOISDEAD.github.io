## Doomsday: My personal blog

![blog image](/images/projects/doomsday/blog.png)

### Brief description

This is my definitive blog about computer science and some other topics. I will try to write about my research, my personal projects and some other things that I find interesting.

The name of the blog is a reference to the [Doomsday argument](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doomsday_argument), a probabilistic argument that claims to predict the number of future members of the human species given only an estimate of the total number of humans born so far.
