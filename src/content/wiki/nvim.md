## Why is Neovim better than Vim?

Neovim have a better support for plugins and LSP (Language Server Protocol), and use the power of lua to make it more extensible and customizable.

|             | Neovim | Vim |
| ----------- | ------ | --- |
| LSP support | x      |     |
| Plugin      | x      | x   |

## Neovim Distributions

My actual and favorite Neovim distribution is AstroNvim, but I have tried others like:

- [SpaceVim](https://spacevim.org/)
- DoomNvim
- ChadNvim
